# Stock EMA Cross Alert System

This project is a Python-based system that monitors stock price movements in relation to the 150 EMA (Exponential Moving Average). The system logs cross-up and cross-down alerts and provides a simple Flask web interface for viewing the results. Docker is used to containerize the application, ensuring a smooth deployment process.

## Features

- **Stock Monitoring**: Detects when stock prices cross the 150 EMA.
- **Alert Logging**: Alerts for cross-ups and cross-downs are logged in `alerts.txt`.
- **Docker Support**: The application can be easily deployed using Docker.
- **Flask Web Interface**: Displays alerts in a web page. (pending)
